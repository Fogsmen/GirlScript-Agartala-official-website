						Welcome guys, we are in with an exciting topic. Can not wait further to share with you all... haven’t you all heard about the news of the hacking of famous personalities
Microsoft Co-founder, Bill Gates; Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos; Tesla CEO, Elon
Musk; former US president, Barak Obama and major brands such as Apple and
Uber which occurred recently 15th July and there is now a huge roar on social
media and news. So today we are also back with the current scenario trying to
bring forth the matter about what is cryptocurrency and what is bitcoin...
Hope you all will find it exhilarating,
So, guys do you know that 1 bitcoin = 6,82,710.44 Indian Rupee?
What’s your feeling now? It’s like OMG!
Let’s try to illustrate broadly now :)
Let me start with the very basics:
<span class="parawhitebg"> So, what is cryptocurrency? </span>
<br>
Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double spend. Many
Cryptocurrency are decentralized networks based on block chain technology. This
decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments
and central authorities.
<br>
<span class="parawhitebg">&nbsp;Blockchains </span> : The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin
transactions. It is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a
hash of the previous block up to the genesis block of the chain.
<br>
<br>
<span class="parablackbg">History of BITCOIN:</span><br>	
The domain name "bitcoin.org" was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October
2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-toPeer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto
implemented the bitcoin software as open source code and released it in January
2009 Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.
On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the
first block of the chain, known as the genesis block. The first major users of
bitcoin were Black Markets, such as Silk Road.
<br>
<br>
<span class="parablackbg">What are the bitcoin wallets?</span>	
<br>A Bitcoin wallet is a not a physical item but a software program for holding
and trading Bitcoin. Wallets contain a private key for security. The key
corresponds to the address of the wallet. The four types of Bitcoin wallet are
desktop, mobile, web, and hardware. To trade in Bitcoin, a trader must establish a
digital wallet. A Bitcoin wallet is analogous to a physical wallet. However, instead
of storing physical currency, the wallet stores relevant information such as the
secure private key used to access Bitcoin addresses and carry out transactions. A
few known desktop wallets are Bitcoin Core, MultiBit, Armory etc.
<br><br>
<span class="parablackbg"> How does a bitcoin works?</span>	
<br>As a new user, you can get started with Bitcoin without understanding the
technical details. Once you've installed a Bitcoin wallet on your computer or mobile
phone, it will generate your first Bitcoin address and you can create more
whenever you need one. You can disclose your address to your friends so that they
can pay you or vice versa. In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works, except
that Bitcoin addresses should be used only once.
<br>
<span class="parawhiteuder">So, can you actually spend it? And what can you buy with bitcoin, anyway?</span>	
You don't need to worry about bitcoin overtaking the dollar anytime soon, but part
of bitcoin's ascension as the foremost cryptocurrency has been that now, whether
you mine Bitcoin or buy bitcoin, there are a variety of places that will accept it as
payment. Many of them are online, but you may be surprised to find that 
depending on where you are, you could be able to find a local bitcoin-accepting
shop near you. Granted, you shouldn't expect a sudden and rapid increase in stores
who take bitcoin. It has a long way to go before becoming widespread.
*Recently, on 15th July 2020, A security incident involving some of the most
prominent business and political leaders on Twitter duped people into sending at
least $120,000 worth of Bitcoin to an anonymous online wallet, and more than half
of that total has already been spirited to other accounts, according to a Bitcointracing company. About $65,000 of the $120,000 collected from duped users has
moved to other Bitcoin addresses, one of which has been active in the past and is
registered with a U.S. exchange, Robinson said.
That money trail could prove useful to investigators in this case, since U.S.
exchanges typically go through vigorous verification of user identities, and would
probably have information on which name the account is registered under. About
half of the funds the hackers acquired came from users in the U.S., a quarter
from Europe and the remainder from Asia, Robinson said. Discovering the
perpetrators could still take time and prove challenging.
Bitcoin is an attractive target for scammers because it can be used worldwide.
While Bitcoin’s price dropped at the beginning of the Covid-19, pandemic, it has
since recovered, and is up roughly 30% since the beginning of the year. (extracted
from The Indian Express).
<br><br>
<span class="parablackbg">Advantages of Bitcoin:</span>
Digital currencies allow users more autonomy over their own money than fiat
currencies do, at least in theory. Bitcoin purchases are discrete. Unless a user
voluntarily publishes his Bitcoin transactions, his purchases are never associated
with his personal identity, much like cash-only purchases, and cannot easily be
traced back to him. In fact, the anonymous bitcoin address that is generated for
user purchases changes with each transaction. The bitcoin payment system is
purely peer-to-peer, meaning that users are able to send and receive payments to
or from anyone on the network around the world without requiring approval from
any external source or authority.
<br><br>
<span class="parablackbg">Disadvantages of Bitcoin:</span>
Bitcoin Are Not Widely Accepted. Bitcoins are still only accepted by a very
small group of online merchants. Wallets Can Be Lost. Bitcoin Valuation
Fluctuates. No Buyer Protection. Risk of Unknown Technical Flaws.
Let’s conclude our blog here for today, hope you all enjoyed it!
<br> <br>
This is the last paragraph of the body. It was a real zinger, driving home my last point.
Gosh, you must think I'm so smart right now. You're on the edge of your seat wondering
how I'm going to bring it all together. OK, here's the last sentence of the last paragraph
of the body I've hit you with some tough love; you've got to make a change.
OK, audience! Now it's your turn! And let us know was the blog useful? And we will be again
back with such new blogs soon! <span class="parawhitebg">Stay tuned!</span>
